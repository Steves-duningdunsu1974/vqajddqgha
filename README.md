Okay, so I just got out of Gap and like... wow, my brain’s like a ping-pong machine, not machine, table. Maybe a marble in a can of spray paint? I'm not even sure what just happened. The theater was so sticky, like don’t they ever clean the floors? Popcorn is everywhere. I think I’m wearing more of it than I ate. Ugh, never sitting in the front row again, my back's convincing me I'm 80. 

> The movie. Right, right. It's wild, a bit like those dreams where you’re falling but not really? One moment I’m trying to figure out who’s who and the next, BAM, there’s this explosion of colors. It's like an art student’s final project crossed with a soap opera. I’m confused if the characters were brothers or maybe not, and there was this scene in the snow which felt warmer than the theater’s air-con blizzard. 

Speaking of brothers, the tension in one scene reminded me of Thanksgiving dinner at Aunt Linda's, but instead of turkey, it's some kind of metaphorical jam, sticky and sweet, but uncomfortable. And don't get me started on the dialogue, it zoomed past my ears like a hummingbird on espresso. Words? Or just sounds? Tough call.

Oh, download the movie if you can, watch it without the theater chaos. Someone asked about it and my brain just glitched like my Wi-Fi on a bad day. Scenes jump around like frogs on a trampoline. There was one with a bridge that seemed to loop in and out, made less sense than quantum physics to a 5-year-old.

> It’s like the director thought, hey, let’s throw spaghetti at the wall and see if it turns into a movie! But you know, there’s this eerie beauty in it all, a bit like listening to a song played backwards at half speed. It's got that Japanese Zen garden vibe in a hurricane kinda way. 

Okay, sidetracked, uh, it’s surreal, it’s loud, a growling catfight between dream and nightmare. Watch it to see if you can make sense where I cannot. I can't tell if I'm in love with it or if it’s like the time I tried to read ancient Greek after two espressos. 

Oh no, look at this, ignore it: 
```
#include <iostream>
void whatIsHappening() {
    int thoughts = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        thoughts += i;
    }
    std::cout << Thoughts:  << thoughts << std::endl;
}
```
